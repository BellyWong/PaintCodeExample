This project shows how to cache drawing code from [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com/) into images for more efficient drawing as described in my [Caching Drawing Code](http://kgn.github.com/blog/2012/03/21/caching-drawing-code/) blog post.

[BBlock](https://github.com/kgn/BBlock) is included as a submodule, so make sure to clone the repo with the `--recursive` flag.
